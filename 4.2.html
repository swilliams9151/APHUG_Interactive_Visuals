          <strong>Time Period:</strong> 1884–1885 and after
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1884–1885, European leaders met at the <strong>Berlin Conference</strong> to decide how to divide the
          continent of Africa among European powers. No African leaders were invited. Europeans drew borders mostly as
          straight lines on a map, based on their own interests and negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These new borders often combined rival ethnic groups into the same state or split cultural groups across
          multiple states. After independence in the 1900s, most African countries kept these colonial borders, which
          still shape politics, conflict, and identity today.

        </p>
        <p>
          For almost 200 years, Britain controlled the Indian subcontinent. After World War II, Indian leaders pushed
          for independence. In 1947, Britain agreed to leave but divided the territory into two main states: India and
          Pakistan. The border was drawn mostly along religious lines—areas with Hindu majorities became India, and
          areas with Muslim majorities became Pakistan.
        </p>
        <p>
          This division caused one of the largest migrations in history. Millions of Hindus and Muslims moved across the
          new borders, and violence broke out between communities. Today, the borders between India and Pakistan remain
          heavily militarized, and the region of Kashmir is still disputed.

        </p>
        <p>
          Yugoslavia was a country in Southeast Europe made up of several different ethnic groups, including Serbs,
          Croats, Bosniaks, Slovenes, Macedonians, and others. After the fall of communism in Europe, tensions between
          these groups increased. In the 1990s, several republics within Yugoslavia declared independence, including
          Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, and later others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The breakup led to violent conflicts, including ethnic cleansing and civil wars. Over time, new internationally
          recognized states formed, and the political map of the Balkans changed dramatically.

        <p>
          Scotland is part of the United Kingdom (UK) but has its own distinct history, legal system, and cultural
          identity. Many people in Scotland identify as Scottish rather than British. In 1999, the UK government granted
          Scotland its own parliament with some control over local issues like education and health. This is an example
          of <strong>devolution</strong>, where power is transferred from the central government to a regional one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014, Scotland held a referendum on whether it should become an independent state. A majority voted to
          remain in the UK, but debates about independence continue, especially after the UK voted to leave the European
          Union (Brexit) while many Scots voted to remain.
